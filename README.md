# League of Legends Patcher v2

![Tool preview](https://i.imgur.com/kg5GhnF.png)

## What's a difference between this patcher and other cheats?

It changes the way how the game works (applies custom patches) so you don't have to run any 3rd part application in the background.
Just patch once and it will work all the time (you can restore backup if you want) - you have to patch every game update.

## Features

* ZoomHack (max) (removes zoom out limit)
* ZoomHack (min) (removes zoom in limit)
* OOM (removes camera X+Y position limits)
* FOV Changer (increases default field of view)
* TOP View (places the camera centrally above the champion)

## Tutorial

1. Close the game (if running)
2. Launch patcher
3. Select features to apply
4. Click PATCH button
