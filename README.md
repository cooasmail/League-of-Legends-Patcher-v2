# League of Legends Patcher v2
## What's a difference between this patcher and other cheats?

It changes the way how the game works (applies custom patches) so you don't have to run any 3rd part application in the background.
Just patch once and it will work all the time (you can restore backup if you want) - you have to patch every game update.

## Features

* ZoomHack (max) (removes zoom out limit)
* ZoomHack (min) (removes zoom in limit)
